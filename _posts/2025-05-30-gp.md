A very short visual introduction to Gaussian processes (GP) and Gaussian process regression (GPR). It is important to understand the distinction between a Gaussian process and Gaussian process regression.

## Gaussian Process

<!-- A Gaussian process is a stochastic process in which any finite collection of random variables has a joint multivariate Gaussian distribution.

A Gaussian process is an extension of the multivariate Gaussian to infinite dimensions. -->

## Gaussian Process Regression

<!-- Gaussian process regression is the process of conditioning a Gaussian process on observed data.

A Gaussian Process (GP) is a prior over functions - you can think of it as a way to generate smooth, plausible random functions before seeing any data. Sampling from a GP gives you random function draws that are consistent with your chosen kernel (e.g. smooth, periodic, rough, etc.). These represent your beliefs about the function before observing data.

The GP samples functions that pass through (or near) the observed data, while capturing uncertainty in areas where you have no observations. -->

The dashed black line represents the *true function* that we are attempting to learn and the black circles represent observed data.
