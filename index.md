# Mark Hobbs

Technical Specialist in the Future Methods group at Rolls-Royce plc. Interested in problems at the intersection of numerical simulation and machine learning. Prior to joining Rolls-Royce, I held a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at The Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national institute for  data science and artificial intelligence, and the University of Exeter, working in the Data-Centric Engineering group. Prior to that, I completed a PhD in Computational Mechanics at the University of Cambridge (Christ's College). This page contains posts on a range of topics including, but not limited to: numerical simulations, uncertainty quantification, design space exploration, optimisation and High Performance Computing (HPC).
