A simple post to visualise the difference between a Gaussian Process and Gaussian Process Regression.

## Gaussian Process

A Gaussian Process (GP) is a prior over functions - you can think of it as a way to generate smooth, plausible random functions before seeing any data. Sampling from a GP gives you random function draws that are consistent with your chosen kernel (e.g. smooth, periodic, rough, etc.). These represent your beliefs about the function before observing data.

## Gaussian Process Regression

Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is what happens when you condition the GP on observed data points. Now, the GP does not just sample random functions - it samples functions that pass through (or near) the training data, while still capturing uncertainty in areas where you have no observations.
