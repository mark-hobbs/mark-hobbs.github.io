## Jekyll

**What is Jekyll?**

## Jekyll site structure

The default site structure provided by Jekyll is as follows:

- `_data/`
- `_drafts/`
- `_includes/`
- `_layouts/`
- `_posts/`
- `_sass/`
- `_site/`
- `assets/`

These directories play different roles in organising and managing the content, layout and styling of the website:

1. `_data/`: This directory is used to store data files in formats like JSON, YAML or CSV. These data files can be accessed directly in your sites templates or pages, allowing you to separate content from presentation and easily update data without modifying the structure of the site.

2. `_drafts/`: Drafts are unfinished posts or pages that are not yet ready to be published. They are stored in this directory until they are finalised. Drafts are not included in the generated site by default, but you can preview them locally during development.

3. `_includes/`: This directory contains snippets of code that can be included in other files using Liquid tags. It allows you to reuse common elements across multiple pages or layouts, such as headers, footers or sidebars.

4. `_layouts/`: Layouts define the overall structure and presentation of your sites pages. They are written in HTML and can include Liquid tags to dynamically insert content. Pages and posts reference specific layouts to determine how they should be displayed.

5. `_posts/`: This directory is used to store dated content, such as blog posts. Each post is typically a Markdown or HTML file named with the date and title. Jekyll processes these files to generate individual pages on the site, sorted by date.

6. `_sass/`: This directory is used to store Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) files, which are CSS preprocessor files. Sass allows you to use variables, mixins, and other features to efficiently manage and organise your sites stylesheets.

7. `_site/`: This directory is automatically generated by Jekyll when you build your site. It contains the compiled HTML, CSS, and any other assets ready for deployment. You should not modify files in this directory directly, as they will be overwritten each time you rebuild the site.

8. `assets/`: This directory is typically used to store static assets such as images, fonts, JavaScript files, or any other files that are not processed by Jekyll. These assets are typically referenced in your sites layouts or pages using relative paths.

Understanding and organising these directories correctly is essential for effectively managing a Jekyll site, allowing you to separate content, layout, and styling concerns for better maintainability and scalability.

## Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)

Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It adds features and capabilities to CSS, making it more efficient and maintainable. Sass files use the `.scss` extension.

Here are some key features and benefits of Sass:

1. **Variables**: Sass allows you to define variables to store reusable values such as colors, font sizes, or any other property value. This makes it easy to maintain consistency across your stylesheets and quickly update values throughout your codebase.

2. **Nesting**: Sass provides the ability to nest CSS rules within one another, which helps to organise and structure your stylesheets in a more hierarchical way. This can make your code more readable and maintainable.

3. **Mixins**: Mixins are reusable blocks of CSS that can be included in other rules. They allow you to encapsulate and reuse common sets of CSS declarations, reducing duplication and making your code more modular.

4. **Functions**: Sass supports functions, which allow you to perform calculations and manipulate values dynamically within your stylesheets. This can be useful for generating complex styles or applying conditional logic.

5. **Partials and Imports**: Sass allows you to break your stylesheets into smaller, more manageable files called partials. These partials can then be imported into other Sass files, allowing you to organise your codebase into logical modules and reuse styles across different files.

6. **Extend/Inheritance**: Sass provides the `@extend` directive, which allows one selector to inherit styles from another selector. This promotes code reuse and can help to keep your stylesheets DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

7. **Control Directives**: Sass includes control directives such as `@if`, `@else`, `@for`, and `@each`, which allow you to apply conditional logic and looping constructs within your stylesheets.

Overall, Sass provides a more powerful and flexible way to write CSS, improving code organisation, readability, and maintainability. It is widely used in web development projects to streamline the process of writing and managing stylesheets.

## `assets/css/main.scss` 

`main.scss` is a common convention used in Sass projects as the entry point for compiling Sass code into CSS. It serves as the main file where you import other Sass files that contain your styles. 

Here's what `main.scss` typically does:

1. **Imports Other Sass Files**: It imports other Sass partials or modules that contain your actual style rules. These partials may represent different sections of your website (e.g., base styles, navigation styles, typography styles, etc.) or modular components.

2. **Combines and Organizes Styles**: By importing multiple Sass files, `main.scss` combines and organizes your styles in a structured manner. Each imported file can focus on a specific aspect of your design, making your codebase more maintainable and modular.

3. **Serves as the Entry Point for Compilation**: When you compile your Sass code into CSS, you typically start with `main.scss`. The Sass compiler processes `main.scss`, resolves any `@import` directives, and outputs a single CSS file that contains all the styles.

Here's an example of what `main.scss` might look like:

```scss
// Import Sass partials or modules
@import 'base'; // Contains base styles
@import 'navigation'; // Contains navigation styles
@import 'typography'; // Contains typography styles
@import 'components/buttons'; // Contains styles for buttons
@import 'components/cards'; // Contains styles for cards
// Other imports...

// Additional custom styles can be added here
```

In this example, `main.scss` imports various Sass files that together form the entire stylesheet for the website. Each imported file may contain styles relevant to its specific purpose, such as base styles, navigation styles, typography styles, and styles for different components or UI elements.

By structuring your Sass code in this way, you can achieve better organization, modularity, and maintainability, which are important considerations for managing larger and more complex CSS codebases.

## `_layouts`

### `default.html`

Create a default html template with a header, body and footer.

### `post.html`

### `about.html`

## Syntax highlighting

Jekyll supports syntax highlighting through the Liquid templating engine and plugins. One of the popular plugins for syntax highlighting in Jekyll is Rouge.

Here are the steps to set up syntax highlighting for Python code in a Jekyll site using Rouge:

1. **Install Rouge**: If Rouge is not already installed, you need to add it to your Jekyll site's Gemfile and run `bundle install`. Add the following line to your Gemfile:

    ```
    gem 'rouge'
    ```

2. **Configure Rouge**: Ensure that Rouge is properly configured in your `_config.yml` file. Add or update the `highlighter` setting to use Rouge:

    ```yaml
    highlighter: rouge
    ```

3. **Usage in Markdown**: When you're writing your posts or pages in Markdown, you can use code fences to specify the language for syntax highlighting. For Python code, you'd do this:

    \```python
    def hello_world():
        print("Hello, world!")
    \```

4. **CSS Styling**: Rouge will add classes to your code blocks for styling. You will need to include CSS styles in your sites CSS file to style these classes. You can find Rouge stylesheets online, or you can customise them according to your preferences.

Here is an example of how you can style Python code with Rouge in your CSS file:

    ```css
    /* Rouge Syntax Highlighting Styles */
    pre {
        overflow-x: auto;
        padding: 1em;
        background-color: #f7f7f7;
        border: 1px solid #ddd;
        border-radius: 0.3em;
    }

    pre code {
        font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Andale Mono', 'Ubuntu Mono', monospace;
        font-size: 0.9em;
    }

    .highlight {
        background-color: #ffffcc;
    }

    .highlight .p {
        color: #ba2121;
    }

    .highlight .n {
        color: #007020;
    }

    .highlight .o {
        color: #666;
    }

    .highlight .c1,
    .highlight .c {
        color: #408080;
        font-style: italic;
    }
    ```

Adjust these styles as needed to fit the aesthetic of your site.

Once you have set up Rouge and styled your code blocks, your Python code should be displayed with syntax highlighting on your Jekyll site.
